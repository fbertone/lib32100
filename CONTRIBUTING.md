# How can you contribute?

** Contributes of any kind are welcome.**

* If you tested the library and it worked, let me know the model of your camera and I'll add it to the supported devices.
* If you tested the library and it did not work, open an issue with as much details as possible.
* If you know more details on the protocol (**especially the camera registration mechanism**) let me know!
* If you PR code please follow the [standard style](https://standardjs.com/), you can run the linter with npm test
